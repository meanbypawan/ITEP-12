1️⃣ Basic MySQL Questions

What is MySQL?

Open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) using SQL.

What are the differences between MySQL and SQL?

SQL = language, MySQL = database software.

What is the difference between CHAR and VARCHAR?

CHAR(n) → fixed-length, VARCHAR(n) → variable-length.

What are primary key, foreign key, and unique key?

Primary key → unique identifier for table row.

Foreign key → links tables.

Unique key → ensures uniqueness but can be NULL.

What are indexes in MySQL?

Indexes improve query performance; can be PRIMARY, UNIQUE, FULLTEXT, INDEX.

2️⃣ Intermediate Questions

What is a View in MySQL?

Virtual table based on a query; simplifies complex queries.

What are joins? Explain types.

Combines data from multiple tables. Types:

INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL OUTER JOIN, SELF JOIN, CROSS JOIN.

What is a stored procedure and trigger?

Stored procedure → precompiled SQL code for repeated execution.

Trigger → automatic action on INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE.

What is normalization? Explain 1NF, 2NF, 3NF.

Process to remove redundancy.

1NF → atomic values

2NF → no partial dependency

3NF → no transitive dependency

What is the difference between WHERE and HAVING?

WHERE → filters rows before aggregation

HAVING → filters groups after aggregation

3️⃣ Advanced Questions

What is the difference between DELETE, TRUNCATE, and DROP?

DELETE → remove rows, can use WHERE, slower, logs changes

TRUNCATE → remove all rows, faster, cannot use WHERE

DROP → remove table structure permanently

What are transactions? Explain ACID properties.

Transactions = group of SQL operations executed as a single unit.

ACID = Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability

What is the difference between INNER JOIN and OUTER JOIN?

INNER JOIN → only matching rows

OUTER JOIN → includes matching + non-matching rows

What are the differences between MyISAM and InnoDB?

Feature	MyISAM	InnoDB
Transaction	No	Yes
Foreign Key	No	Yes
Locking	Table-level	Row-level
Crash Recovery	No	Yes

What are temporary tables in MySQL?

Tables created for session-specific tasks, automatically deleted at session end.

4️⃣ Practical/Query Questions

Write a query to find the second highest salary from the employee table.

Write a query to list employees with their manager names using SELF JOIN.

Write a query to count employees in each department (GROUP BY).

Write a query to find employees not assigned to any department (NULL dept_id).

Write a query to update salary by 10% for employees in IT department.

5️⃣ Tips for Interviews

Be familiar with DDL, DML, DCL, TCL commands.

Practice joins, subqueries, aggregation, group by, having, order by.

Know indexing, transactions, foreign keys.

Be ready to explain real-world scenarios, e.g., normalization, employee-manager relationships.
